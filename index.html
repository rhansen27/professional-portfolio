        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 24 year old full stack developer in training. I am currently
          attending the University of Wisconsin front end developer bootcamp and
          am looking to expand my knowledge and experience in the field. I am a
          very hard working and dedicated learner who is always looking for new
          opportunities to learn and grow. I have been very passionate about
          coding since I was young. I have moderate experience in Java and C++
          and am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By the end of my
          bootcamp I will have a strong understanding of full stack development
          and the MERN tech stack.

            <p>
              This first project was a project based on refactoring a given
              website to use all semantic HTML elements where applicable. During
              this project I learned a lot about HTML structuring and how to
              make a more accessible website. I also learned about basic CSS
              styling as well as learning the basics of version control and
              project deployment.

                In this project I created a simple game of rock, paper, scissors
                in JavaScript in order to familiarize myself with the language.
                I learned a lot about the basics of JavaScript such as
                variables, functions, loops and conditional control structures.
